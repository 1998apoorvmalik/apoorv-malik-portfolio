    <h5>Generic Genetic Algorithm:</h5>
    Python project for abstract & general implementation of the Genetic Algorithm. It can be used to solve all kinds of relevant problems, such as
    n-queens, 8-puzzle, 15-puzzle, target string problem, knapsack problem, and all those problems which feature deterministic state change
    (deterministic transition) and are quantifiable by a reward function.

    <h5>Chess Game:</h5>
    A game of chess entirely made from scratch in Flutter. I have coded everything using no packages, libraries, or plugins - including game logic,
    game board, NegaMax algorithm-based Al, and online multiplayer.

    <h5>Teachable Image Classifier:</h5>
    Similar to Google's teachable machine, this project provides a visual interface for training Deep Learning models by allowing users to create
    classes, add image samples, and set training parameters.

    <h5>Sorting Algorithm Visualizer:</h5>
    Developed this program with Flutter. It enables us to visualize how complex sorting algorithms (Merge, Heap, Quick, Bubble & Insertion Sort) work.

  <li class="mt-3">
    <h5>ASK Fras-Le Friction PVT. LTD:</h5>
    Created an application to perform dimensional analysis and classification of brake liners. Multiple vision cameras above the conveyor line
    calculate the dimensions of an incoming part, which is then further analyzed to classify it as ok or not good (based on some tolerance level).
  </li>
  <li class="mt-3">
    <h5>Samsung India:</h5>
    Shape and color inspection of SMT nozzles. The software inspected and categorized the incoming part as ok or not good based on specific features.
    There were 40 different part categories the algorithm had to learn.
  </li>
  <li class="mt-3">
    <h5>Minda Group:</h5>
    Completed two different projects for this company - developed an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) algorithm for number reading in Automotive
    Key Tags. And implemented a deep learning-based solution for classification & categorization of wheel rims.

    <h5>Forward Planning Agent:</h5>
    Combined symbolic logic and classical search to implement a progression search agent to solve planning problems and experimented with different
    search algorithms (A*, DFS, BFS, UCS, etc.) & heuristics (Set Level, Max Level, Level Sum, Unmet Goals, etc.). Finally, used the results to answer
    questions about designing planning systems.
