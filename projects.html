<h4>LinearAlifold</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
      Implemented and contributed to the development of a dynamic programming algorithm for RNA alignments'
      linear-time consensus structure prediction. It incorporates beam pruning (for enhanced computational efficiency),
      multiple energy parameters, and various computational modes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enabled the calculation of the partition function and base pairing probabilities, along with support for predicting
      Minimum Free Energy (MFE), Maximum Expected Accuracy (MEA), and Centroid structures, enhancing the
      algorithm's utility and precision.
    </li>
    <li>
      Developed a web server for providing users the ability to input their own sequences and perform various functions,
      thereby enhancing practical applications of the tool.

    <h5>Forward Planning Agent:</h5>
    Combined symbolic logic and classical search to implement a progression search agent to solve planning problems and experimented with different
    search algorithms (A*, DFS, BFS, UCS, etc.) & heuristics (Set Level, Max Level, Level Sum, Unmet Goals, etc.). Finally, used the results to answer
    questions about designing planning systems.
